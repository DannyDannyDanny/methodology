## Documentation Methodology

The project planning happens on the _Jira board_ and the project documentation is added to _Confluence pages_.
The setting up of Jira & Confluence is outlined in [Project Lifecycle](project_planning.md#project-lifecycle).

### General Tips
* Include conceptual graphical documentation as inline embedded images.
* Save Matplotlib / Seaborn plots as `.svg`.
* Sketches and handwritten illustrations scanned / photographed as `.png`/`.jpg`.
* Scanned / photographed illustrations should be cropped, contrast and alligned.
* Technical Writing resources
