There should be a majority yes answers to the following questions - if not, it's probably time to find something else.

* Accomplishment: Have I done anything noteworthy these last three months? 
* Impact: Would I write a line in my resume about the work I have done over these three months? Would I value this specific work experience if I was hiring for my own company?
* Growth/Future alignment: Have I acquired valuable insights or skills? Are these skills aligned with my future goals?
* Challenge: Have there been days when I was thinking about a work problem in the shower so profoundly that I forgot if I used the soap or not?
* Community: Am I excited and happy to go to work every morning and see my teammates. Do I believe in the mission, vision, and leadership of this team or company?
